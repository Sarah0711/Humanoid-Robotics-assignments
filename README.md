Humanoid robots are currently an active research platform. Since they have a human-like body plan they can act in environments designed for humans. 
Humanoid robots are able to, e.g., climb stairs, walk through cluttered environments, manipulate objects, and open doors.

## Results
When you push your code to the GIT server, the server will automatically build, run, and test your code.

After a few seconds, the results are available in the [project wiki](https://gitlab.igg.uni-bonn.de/hr-ss19/group-25/wikis/home).

## Instructions for building the exercises on your own computer:
